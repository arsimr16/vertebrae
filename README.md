This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

A (chiro)practical introduction to backbone.js

## Introduction
**Technologies**

**Context**
Backbone is the first of many MVC (model-view-controller) frameworks you will be introduced to. It is the most prevalent framework in use today. You'll walk through the basics, and see how a simple application might work. Work through the tutorial steps in the /tutorial folder for an introduction to Backbone's flavor of MVC:

**models**
* The persistent application data
**views**
* The rendered data visible to the user
**collections**
* Groupings of models using underscore functions

## Environment
Requirements
* Bower 1.3.x
Installing Dependencies
* npm install or bower install

## Objectives
**Bare Minimum Requirements**
Complete all four steps in the /tutorial folder:
* Models and Events
* Rendering
* Views
* Collections
